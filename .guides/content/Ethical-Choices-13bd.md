For each scenario, decide whether each is legal or not and justify your answer.

1) A copy of a book is downloaded for a school assignment.  Had the student not downloaded it, they would have checked it out of the library for free.

2) A friend gives you a copy of a Linux operating system and you install it on your computer.

3) A copy of Pride and Prejudice is downloaded off of the Internet.  The contents are changed to add Zombies and the resulting work is sold for money.

4) A song is downloaded from a torrent site which allows users to share files.

5) A copy of Microsoft Word is downloaded by a student to finish a report.  The student didnâ€™t have a product key so they used one from a friend.
